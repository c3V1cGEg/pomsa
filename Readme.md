# **POMSA - Poor old mans sports app**

## **Goal:**
Implement as simple sports tracker for recording activities as possible (HTML5 only, no app).

## **Prerequisites:**
* you need your personal google maps API key and Maps JavaScript API and Geocoding API enabled. (Don't forget quotas and restrictions for your api key)
* html file needs to be hosted somewhere on https server (podman, docker, syno, qnap, etc.)
* browser needs to have access high accuracy GPS data
* Optional: for permanent track recordings you have to implement data receiver to handle data sent by the html. Currently commented out.
